## 💭 About This Report

This IB Extended Essay represents a seminal work in the field of engineering, specifically the mathematical properties that underpin civil structures, with particular focus on the standard suspension bridge design. Through a rigorous analysis of the bridge's catenary shape and structural design, the author has derived a simplified formula that expresses the maximum bearable load of a suspension bridge based on key variables such as the number of bridge towers, suspender cables, and the cables' catenary geometry.

In addition to the mathematical analysis, empirical data was interpreted to formulate a generalized formula for estimating the costs associated with building suspension bridges, using similar variables for ease of comparison between maximum bearable load and costs. Furthermore, a method of optimizing cost efficiency for standardized suspension bridge designs was developed by maximizing the greatest bearable load while minimizing costs.

Drawing upon the mathematical investigations detailed above, the cost-optimizing equations were implemented in a practical context, culminating in the visualization of a potential bridge between Tuas and Jurong Island, Singapore's two major industrial districts. The proposed bridge represents an innovative solution to the transportation of industrial goods and the reduction of road pollution, providing a direct connection between the two major areas for more efficient movement of goods and services.
